            <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India. He studied law in London and later practiced law in South Africa, where he experienced racial discrimination and began his journey as a social activist.</p>

            <h2>The Salt March</h2>

            <p>In 1930, Gandhi led the famous Salt March, a nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly. The march lasted 24 days and covered 240 miles, from Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad to the Arabian Sea. This event sparked a nationwide civil disobedience movement and brought international attention to the Indian independence struggle.</p>

            <h2>Nonviolent Resistance</h2>

            <p>Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance, known as Satyagraha, was a key factor in India's independence movement. He believed in using peaceful means, such as civil disobedience and non-cooperation, to achieve political and social goals. His methods inspired civil rights movements around the world, including the work of Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States.</p>
